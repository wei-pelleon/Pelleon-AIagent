Now, you need to take the original material need, the options for each material, and the design, function, and cost reduction attributes to the UI. 

For each material, you need to first show the original material; then below, you need to show the candidates as dropdown list, and when a candidate is selected, you can see the deisgn, function deviations, and also cost reductions too. 

You list all materials like this.

You also show a total average design intent deviation, total average functional intent deviation, and also, total cost reduction in the UI, by material category (window, door, appliance),

Whenever something is changed from the dropdown, you need to re-calculate the above criterias.

Create a beautiful, professional, white and light gray theme, with small but beautiful and professional font. You need to work with the candidates file in data/processed/ folder to get the alternatives right? 

Now create this UI. You would use React. Make sure it is tested incrementally and enhanced incrementally. 

I would create this UI and launch on localhost for now.
